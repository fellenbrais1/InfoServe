          Specify the database and table(s) to draw from, and then apply
          filters, and our <em>'Query Builder'</em> feature does the hard work
          for you, writing the exact SQL queries to get the job done, all from
          within your Google Sheet!<br />
          Set it up on a weekly, monthly, whatever schedule you want!<br />
          It has never been easier than with <em>MySQL-Wizard</em>!<br />
