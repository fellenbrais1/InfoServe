Getting requirements for the DataWizard google extension for the company InfoServe

Client: Tom McCann, founder InfoServe / Coder

What is the product?: (Checking)
InfoServe is a SASS (Software as a Service business)

Product name:

DataWizard (check name) is a product that allows users to install the extension and then search large SQL databases more easily

DataWizard allows users to specify areas of their database to search and other parameters and DataWizard will auto generate correpsonding SQL queries

It comes as a google extenstion that runs in a side window on top of google sheets etc

What (product):
How does it output? (What does the user output look like?)

Would you like to display samples of output on the webpage?

How is it installed (search through the google extensions tab?)

Would you like to display images of this process on the webpage?

Who:
Who is the website meant to appeal to?
=My ideas
-People searching through large quantities of data that need SQL queries written
-People who are not proficient at generating SQL queries that still need to search databases
-People who need to do a complex search quickly and more easily
