        Data, hugely useful stuff for a business, but let's be honest, it can be
        horrible sifting through it to get what you want. <br />
        Many people find it difficult to write effective SQL queries to get at
        the information they need, but that's where we've got you covered.
        DataWizard is all about enabling easier data processing. Specify your
        specific queries using our handy tool, and sit back while the DataWizard
        writes bespoke, professional SQL queries and trawls your data for you to
        bring you the information you need.
        <br />

        We are so confident in the DataWizard's ability to provide you with the
        SQL searches you need that we offer it as a trial for your first 10

        But lets look at more reasons the DataWizard can help you, shall we?
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          DataWizard writes bespoke SQL queries based on your selected
          requirements
        </li>
        <li>DataWizard already knows the column and row headings your data</li>
        <li>DataWizard has a simple and easy to use interface</li>
        <li>
          DataWizard seemlessly works with your G Suite tools without cumbersome
          addons
        </li>
        <li>
          DataWizard can also do more advanced functions, go into the advanced
          settings and see how versatile it really is
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>This is what other users of DataWizard have said:</h3>

          <p>
            I used to have terrible trouble messing around with SQL queries
            (which I barely understand!) to search my companies database. Now
            with DataWizard, all the hard work is taken care of, and I can spend
            my energy where it is needed, on doing my actual job!
          </p>

          <img

            width=""
            height=""
          />
          <p>
            I used to dread having to search for specific data in my database, I
            actually used to get all the data I needed separately, and then make
            a new document with all the data combined! Needless to say, that
            doesn't need to be done with a tool like DataWizard on your side, I
            highly recommend anyone who needs to work with big data to install
            this extension.

          <p>
            DataWizard is the best! I have been looking for an extension to do
            exactly this for ages! And here it is! &smile;
